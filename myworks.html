        <h1>My works :
        </h1>
        <p>I have completed a few cources on Courcera. 
        I have just created my Github account where I plan to post my works and researches.<br>
        I have attended a workshop on Drone Surevelliance at Ragam,NIT Calicut recently where my team had an 
        opportunity to program and fly a drone. Using an app, we were able to control the drone and take pictures of an object in the hill. We then compiled the images to get a 360 view of the image.
        <br>It was a wonderful experience. </p>
        <p>I plan to post some works soon, Do keep a watch on my Github account.</p>
