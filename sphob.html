        <p>I had a huge interest in playing sports, Particularly Badminton. So, I was enrolled in the coaching class of Mr.Sunil, who is the father of the famous Indian badminton player,Pranoy.
            I was present in his coaching class for around 7 years!! He used to take me to District Level tournaments. I was ranked 2nd in the District Level Tournament organised by Yonex at Thiruvananthapuram.
        <br>I am also a member of the All India Badminton Association.

        <p>I enjoy cycling too. At every free time, I take my cycle to the beach and back. I also used to go for long rides ranging about 50 kms.
            I am also part of many cycling clubs in the city.<br>
            Therefore, my father bought me a MTB(Mountain Bike) of Firefox which allowed me to go for long distances. After that, we planned a 50 people ride to Kovalam which was a huge successs.
