        <h1>TRAVEL</h1>
        <h1>Who does n't like to travel?</h1>
        <p>In always like to travel, the hours do not bother me. As soon as a vacation pops up, I pack my bags to start my travel</p>
        <p>I have visited many places in Kerala such as Munnar and Wayanad. I enjoyed the drive through the churam(hills) and all the way through the hairpin bends and so on..
            I have visited Ponmudi too. Outside Kerala, Kodaikanal and Ooty are the places I visit the most. Once,I went to Yercaud near Salem.
        <br>
        I had gone to Aurangabad once and it was a once in a lifetime experience. I visited the Ajanta and Ellora caves and they were a beauty. It was too surprising to see the works of our ancestors and the carvings.
            I visited the "Bibi-ka-Maquara" which is also called the "Duplicate TajMahal" that was built by Aurangzeb.
        </p>
        <p>Outside India, I have visited Singapore and Malaysia. It too was a once in a life time experience .
            <br>I like to travel alone sometimes. I have travelled to Chennai many times alone and it was awesome..
